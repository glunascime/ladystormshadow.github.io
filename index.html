    <h3 class="post-title">How it started?</h3>
    <div class="post-content">
    <p>Quietly, in December we all started to receive some news about a <strong>new virus</strong> that was getting spread in Wuhan - China.
      January begun and things got really serious: the virus spread accross europe and when February was almost over,
      Brazil had the first infected patient and has been downhill from here.</p>
    <p>Here we have a dumbass president(<em>sorry, but ask around... It's true</em>), miscomunication inside the government
      and between then and the people and that's just the tip of the iceberg...</p>

      <h3 class="post-title">What has been done?</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
      <p>Since it all begun, some mesures has been taken. Like washing hands more often, using hand-sanitazer more than you can count
        and now we wear masks <strong>anytime</strong> we go out. Almost every store is closed and everything turned to delivery.
      If there's any silver lining in this, we have some more time to try new things at home...
      Like me baking. I'll talk more about it later.</p>
      <p>The not <em>nearly bright</em> side has been people losing their jobs, the number of deaths are over 5000,
        the health care system is overwhelmed... Everything is a mess. Two months passed and things aren't getting better.
        But the best that can be done right now is <strong>Stay the fuck home</strong> and kinda wait for the best.
        It's sad.</p>
